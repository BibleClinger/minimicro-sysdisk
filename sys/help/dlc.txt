Downloadable Content

In addition to the small games/demos available in the `/sys/demo`
folder, there are larger, more polished games and programs which
can be downloaded from the web.  Many of these are available at
`https://miniscript.org/MiniMicro/dlc`.  To use them:

1. Go to that URL in your favorite web browser.

2. Download one of the programs you find there.  It should come
down as a .minidisk file, for example, `WorldConquest.minidisk`.

3. Click on the top disk slot below the screen.  From the pop-up
menu that appears, choose `Mount Disk Fileâ€¦`.

4. Select the .minidisk file you downloaded in Step 2.

5. Quit and relaunch Mini Micro (or enter `cd; load "start"; run`).

To get back to your own files, click the disk slot again, and use 
either `Mount Folder` or `Mount Disk File` to load your own user disk.
