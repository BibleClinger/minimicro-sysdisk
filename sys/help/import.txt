The `import` command loads a MiniScript file from the current
directory, `/sys/lib`, `/usr/lib`, or some path defined in
`env.importPaths`.  Any values defined by that code then become
available in a map of the same name.  Example:

`import "mathUtil"`
`print mathUtil.radToDeg(2*pi)`  // prints 360

Some modules, like `listUtil`, `stringUtil`, and `mapUtil`, extend these
built-in types with new methods.  For example, the built-in `list`
type does not have a `.reverse` method, but it does once you import
"listUtil":

`import "listUtil"`
`print [1,2,3].reverse`  // prints [3, 2, 1]

Be sure to `view` (or `load` and `edit`) the modules in `/sys/lib`
to see what they do, and how they work!
